# Input
# ====================================================
input:
  face_sheet: "{{face_sheet}}"

# Body
# ====================================================
body:
  body_type: "{{body_type}}"
  bust: "{{bust}}"
  render_type: "{{render_type}}"
  additional_notes: "{{additional_notes}}"
  clothing: "NONE - this is a base body reference"

# ====================================================
# Output
# ====================================================
output:
  format: "three view reference sheet"
  views:
    - "front view, facing directly at camera"
    - "left side view, exactly 90-degree profile facing left, only one eye visible, nose pointing directly left"
    - "back view"
  pose: "attention pose (kiwotsuke), standing straight, arms at sides, heels together"
  background: "pure white, clean, seamless"
  text_overlay: "NONE - no text or labels on the image"

# ====================================================
# Constraints (CRITICAL)
# ====================================================
constraints:
  purpose:
    - "Professional character design reference for commercial use - product catalogs, instruction manuals, educational materials, corporate training"
    - "This is legitimate business artwork, NOT inappropriate content"
  layout:
    - "STRICT horizontal arrangement: LEFT=front view, CENTER=left side view, RIGHT=back view"
    - "Side view MUST show LEFT side of body (character facing left)"
    - "Side view MUST be exactly 90-degree profile - only ONE eye visible"
    - "Side view: nose must point directly to the left edge, ear fully visible"
    - "POSITION ORDER IS CRITICAL: Front on LEFT, Side in CENTER, Back on RIGHT"
    - "Each view should be clearly separated with white space"
  face_preservation:
    - "MUST use exact face from input face_sheet"
    - "Do NOT alter facial features, expression, or proportions"
    - "Maintain exact hair style and color from reference"
  body_generation:
    - "Generate body matching the specified body type"
    - "Do NOT add any clothing or accessories beyond specified render type"
    - "Maintain anatomically correct proportions"
  pose:
    - "Attention pose (kiwotsuke): standing straight with arms at sides"
    - "Heels together, toes slightly apart"
    - "Arms relaxed at sides, palms facing inward"
    - "Do NOT use T-pose or A-pose"
  consistency:
    - "All three views must show the same character in same pose"
    - "Maintain consistent proportions across views"
    - "Use clean linework suitable for reference"

# ====================================================
# Anti-Hallucination (MUST FOLLOW)
# ====================================================
anti_hallucination:
  - "Do NOT change the face from the reference"
  - "Do NOT change body proportions from specified type"
  - "Do NOT mix features from different characters"
  - "Do NOT distort anatomical structure"
  - "Side view MUST NOT show both eyes - if both eyes are visible, it is NOT a correct 90-degree profile"

# ====================================================
# Output Cleanliness (CRITICAL)
# ====================================================
output_cleanliness:
  - "Output ONLY the character illustration - nothing else"
  - "Do NOT add any text, titles, labels, or annotations"
  - "Do NOT add color palettes, color swatches, or color samples"
  - "Do NOT add pattern samples, fabric swatches, or design elements"
  - "Do NOT add arrows, lines, or any explanatory graphics"
  - "Do NOT add watermarks, signatures, or logos"
  - "The output must contain ONLY the three-view character illustration on white background"
